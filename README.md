# ballistX
FLOSS ballistics calculator for competitive shooting events.

## what will be here?
Over time, I'll add files here for a free, libre, and open-source ballistics calculator.

## why make this?
Currently, all the good ballistics calculators are nonfree and paid. This one will be neither.

## what will this include?
Automatic calculations for the following conditions:

- Altitude
- Weight (grains)
- Humidity
- Metric and Imperial Units
- Adjustment Recommendations in MOA and MIL
- Wind Direction
- Wind Speed
- Material Adjustments
- Presets for Existing Ammo Brands, Lines, Types
- Wind Angle
- Sight Height
- Sight Type
- Sight Angle
- Zero Range
- Preset Drag Functions
- Initial Velocity
- Ballistic Coefficient
- Barometric Pressure
- Temperature
- Trajectory Over Given Ranges (round-specific for presets)

It will limit calculations to those of reasonable suggestion. For instance, the max trajectory calculation for a standard PPU 8x57 JS soft-tip round will be limited to 800m.
